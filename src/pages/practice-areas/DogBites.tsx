                Dog bites can lead to serious physical injuries and emotional trauma, leaving victims with mounting medical bills and long-term recovery needs. In Texas, dog owners are responsible for ensuring their pets do not cause harm, and when they fail to do so, they can be held liable for the injuries caused.

                Why Hire a Dog Bite Injury Lawyer?

                Dog bite injury cases can be complex, especially when it comes to determining liability and negotiating with insurance companies. Texas follows a "one bite rule" which means that an owner may be held strictly liable if their dog has previously shown aggressive tendencies, but negligence and premises liability laws can also play a role.
              </p>

                Common Injuries from Dog Bites
              </h3>
              
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Dog bites can cause a range of serious injuries, depending on the size and breed of the dog, and the circumstances surrounding the attack. Some common injuries include:
              </p>
              
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
                <li><strong>Puncture wounds:</strong> Deep wounds caused by the dog's teeth penetrating the skin, which can lead to infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Lacerations and scarring:</strong> Cuts that may require stitches and result in permanent scars, especially on visible areas like the face.</li>
                <li><strong>Nerve damage:</strong> Bites can cause damage to nerves, leading to loss of sensation or function in the affected area.</li>
                <li><strong>Bone fractures:</strong> Particularly in children or smaller individuals, a dog bite can break or fracture bones.</li>
                <li><strong>Infections:</strong> Bacterial infections like rabies, tetanus, and MRSA are serious concerns with dog bites.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional trauma:</strong> Many victims experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, or fear around dogs after an attack.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">

                Texas Laws on Dog Bite Liability
              </h3>
              
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Texas dog bite laws allow victims to pursue compensation under two primary legal theories:
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Premises Liability:</strong> If the dog bite occurred on someone else's property (such as at a business or in a residential area), the property owner or occupier may be liable for failing to protect visitors from the dangerous dog.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Negligence:</strong> If a dog owner fails to take reasonable steps to prevent their dog from injuring someone (such as properly restraining or training the dog), they may be held liable for injuries caused by the bite.
              </p>

                Compensation for Dog Bite Victims

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Dog bites can lead to significant financial burdens for victims, including medical expenses, lost wages, and long-term rehabilitation. At SVR Law Firm, we will pursue compensation for:
              </p>
              
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700">
                <li><strong>Medical bills:</strong> Including emergency room visits, surgeries, medications, and ongoing treatments like physical therapy.</li>
                <li><strong>Lost wages:</strong> Compensation for time missed from work due to your injuries and recovery.</li>
                <li><strong>Pain and suffering:</strong> Non-economic damages for the emotional distress, trauma, and physical pain caused by the attack.</li>
                <li><strong>Scarring and disfigurement:</strong> Permanent scars, especially on the face or other visible areas, can impact your quality of life and self-esteem.</li>
                <li><strong>Rehabilitation costs:</strong> Including therapy for physical and emotional recovery.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                In the tragic event that a dog attack results in death, surviving family members may also pursue wrongful death claims to cover funeral expenses and loss of companionship.

                <li><strong>Document the incident:</strong> Take photos of your injuries and the location of the attack. If possible, get the dog owner's contact information.</li>
                <li><strong>Report the bite:</strong> File a report with local animal control or the police to ensure there is an official record of the attack.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid speaking with the dog owner's insurance company:</strong> Let your attorney handle all communications with insurers to prevent them from minimizing your claim.</li>

                    A: Yes, you may still have a claim even if the bite occurred on the dog owner's property.
