                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    A: In Texas, the statute of limitations for personal injury claims, including slip and fall accidents, is two years from the date of the accident. It's important to contact an attorney as soon as possible to preserve your rights.

                  <p className="text-gray-700">
                    A: Under Texas's modified comparative fault rule, you can still recover compensation if you were less than 51% at fault for the accident. However, your compensation will be reduced by your percentage of fault.
